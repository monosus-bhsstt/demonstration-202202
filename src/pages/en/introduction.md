This document explains how the (realistic) current state of the modern web frontend can contribute to website development and better website management.

- Maximize UX contribution
- Secure development
- Efficient operation

This presentation will show you what you need to know and what options you have for web application and site development in this long term transition period.

## UX > DX

<sub><sup>DX = Developer Experience</sup></sub>

A better user experience cannot be solved by design alone. ï¼ˆA better user experience cannot be solved by design alone (of course, without good design, users won't even look at your site).

(Of course, without good design, users won't even look at your site.) If your site lags by two seconds, half of your users may not browse other pages on your website.

Fast website display is one of the most important UX to consider.

### DX takes precedence.

Heavy carousels, included navigation, uncompressed images, CSS that will never be used again, javascript needed for different devices, Internet Explorer support, unnecessary JQuery...

In the process of creating and operating an attractive website within a limited time and budget, it is easy for the provider's convenience to take precedence over user benefits.

The QCD consensus point may be necessary for the moment of release. But are we building a website for release? (No, we are not!).

This problem is not made up for by ambition, but rather by considering how web content will be delivered and creating an environment for developing optimized source code, which will solve much of the problem.

1. Vision
2. Issue
3. Design
4. Development

You need to know how to improve UX in the implementation and development stage, which is the closest to the user among the four stages of a project.

### Discard DX?

As a developer myself, I'm always looking for ways to make source code more "writable". As a developer myself, I'm always looking for ways to improve the "writing quality" of source code, and web developers around the world continue to solve problems to improve DX and achieve better UX. (All product managers should be thankful for OSS once again.)

Some of the first pieces of knowledge that have been solved and will be considered are

- Component Driven Development (CDD)
- Programmatic code inspection (TypeScript, ESLint)
- Consistent CI/CD
- Environment-independent development environment (node.js)

Environment-independent development environment (node.js)
If continuity and reusability can be managed digitally, quality assurance, schedule, and resource constraints can be greatly reduced, and the synergistic effect of improving UX will improve DX.

Easy is good, simple is always good.
